    question: John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes.  How many times does he use
      the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '3'
    gold_reasoning: The movie last 2.5*60=<<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes So he uses the
      bathroom 150/50=<<150/50=3>>3 times
- inputs:
    question: Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon. In 2005, Jorge is 16 years old.
      In 2010, how old would Simon be?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '45'
    gold_reasoning: In 2005, Simon was 16+24 = <<16+24=40>>40 years old. There are
      2010-2005 = <<2010-2005=5>>5 years between 2005 and 2010. In 2010 Simon would
      be 40+5 = 45 years old.

    question: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the
      amount of the discount?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '6'
    gold_reasoning: 'Let x be the amount of the discount. We have, 22 - x = $16 We
      change the writing of the equation: 22 - x + x = 16 + x So, 22 = 16 + x We then
      Remove 16 from both sides: 22 - 16 = 16 + x - 16 So, 22 - 16 = x So, the amount
      of the discount is x = $<<6=6>>6.'
- inputs:
    question: Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington. If Washington has 140
      goats, how many goats do they have in total?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '320'
    gold_reasoning: If Washington has 140 goats, Washington has 140+40 = <<140+40=180>>180
      goats. In total, they have 140+180 = <<140+180=320>>320 goats
- inputs:
    question: Robin likes to bake cupcakes for friends and to make her puppy North
      happy. Once Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce and twice as many cupcakes
      with buttercream frosting on her own. How many cupcakes did Robin eat?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '12'
    gold_reasoning: Robin ate twice as many buttercream cupcakes as chocolate sauce
      cupcakes, or 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8. So in total she ate 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 cupcakes.
