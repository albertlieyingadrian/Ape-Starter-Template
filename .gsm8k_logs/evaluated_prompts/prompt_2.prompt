    question: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on
      Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were
      not sold?

    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '600'
    gold_reasoning: "We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60\
      \ + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books. So the total number\
      \ of books that were not sold is: 800 \u2013 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books."

    question: A store sold a certain brand of jeans for $40. They only have few pairs
      of jeans left so they decided to give 10% discount on every two pairs of jeans
      bought by a customer at any one time. How much will a customer pay for 3 pairs
      of jeans?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '112'
    gold_reasoning: Two pairs of jeans cost $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80. A discount of
      $80 x 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8 will be given for this. Hence, the cost of
      two pairs of jeans will now be $80 - $8 = $<<80-8=72>>72. Therefore, the customer
      will pay $72 + $40 = $<<72+40=112>>112 for the three pairs of jeans.

    question: Billy is breeding mice for an experiment. He starts with 8 mice, who
      each have 6 pups. When the pups grow up, all the mice have another 6 pups. Then
      each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How
      many mice are left?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '280'
    gold_reasoning: 'First find the number of pups in the first generation: 8 mice
      * 6 pups/mouse = <<8*6=48>>48 pups Then add the number of adult mice to find
      the total number of mice: 48 pups + 8 mice = <<48+8=56>>56 mice Then find the
      number of pups per mouse that survive from the second generation: 6 pups/mouse
      - 2 pups/mouse = <<6-2=4>>4 pups/mouse Then multiply that number by the number
      of adult mice to find the number of pups in the second generation: 56 mice *
      4 pups/mouse = <<56*4=224>>224 mice Then add the number of adult mice to the
      number of second-generation pups to find the total number of mice: 224 mice
      + 56 mice = <<224+56=280>>280 mice'

    question: Charlotte needs to know how much money to have with her when she goes
      to the shoe store. How much money should Charlotte bring to buy a pair of boots,
      if the original price is $90 and there is a discount of 20%?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '72'
    gold_reasoning: The amount of the discount is 20/100 * $90 original price = $<<20/100*90=18>>18
      Charlotte needs to bring the $90 - $18 discount = $<<90-18=72>>72

    question: "It\u2019s spring! The gardener at Parc Municipal orders flowers. He\
      \ takes 250 tulips, 375 carnations and 320 roses. Each flower is sold for 2\u20AC\
      . Calculate the total expenses."
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '1890'
    gold_reasoning: "First we calculate the number of flowers: 250 + 375 + 320 = <<250+375+320=945>>945\u20AC\
      \ Then the expense: 945 X 2 = <<945*2=1890>>1890\u20AC So, the total expenditure\
