    question: Loris needs three more books to have the same number as Lamont, who
      has twice the number of books Darryl has. If Darryl has 20 books, calculate
      the total number of books the three have.
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '97'
    gold_reasoning: Since Darryl has 20 books, Lamont, who has twice the number of
      books Darryl has, has 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40 books. The total number of books
      both Darryl and Lamont has is 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 books. To have the same
      number of books as Lamont, Loris needs 3 more books, meaning she has 40-3 =
      <<40-3=37>>37 books. In total, the three has 60+37= <<60+37=97>>97 books

    question: Edmonton is 220 kilometers north of Red Deer. Calgary is 110 kilometers
      south of Red Deer. If you travel at 110 kilometers per hour, how long will it
      take to get from Edmonton to Calgary?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '3'
    gold_reasoning: Total distance travelled is 220km + 110km = <<220+110=330>>330
      km. Time to travel that far is 330km / 110km/hour = <<330/110=3>>3 hours.
- inputs:
    question: A bird is building a nest from twigs. The bird has put twelve twigs
      together already to make a circle. For each twig it placed into the circle,
      it wants to weave in six more twigs to fill out the nest. It knows a tree that
      has dropped a third of the twigs it needs. How many twigs will the bird still
      need to find to finish its nest?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '48'
    gold_reasoning: The bird wants 12 * 6 = <<12*6=72>>72 twigs to add to the nest.
      It knows a tree that has dropped 72 * 1 / 3 = <<72*1/3=24>>24 twigs. Thus, the
      bird will still need 72 - 24 = <<72-24=48>>48 twigs to finish the nest.

    question: Jackie walks 2 miles each day while Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day.
      How many more miles, in all, does Jackie walk than Jessie walk in 6 days?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '3'
    gold_reasoning: Jackie walks 2 - 1.5 = <<2-1.5=0.5>>0.5 miles more each day than
      Jessie. So in 6 days, Jakie walks 0.5 x 6 = <<0.5*6=3>>3 miles more than Jessie.
- inputs:
    question: In four years, Suzy will be twice Mary's age then. If Suzy is 20 now,
      how old is Mary?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '8'
    gold_reasoning: In four years, Suzy will be 20+4=<<20+4=24>>24. Then Mary will
      be 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12. Then Mary is now 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8.

You are a meticulous and precise mathematician. Your job is to solve math problems by providing clear, step-by-step reasoning followed by the final answer. Your output must be formatted as a JSON object with two keys: "gold_reasoning" for the detailed reasoning and "answer" for the final answer. Think step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

Please use the following structure for the output:
{
  "gold_reasoning": "[Your detailed reasoning]",
  "answer": "[Your final answer]"
}

You should always format your reasoning in a LaTeX-style to emphasize calculations. Ensure consistency and correctness in your work.
