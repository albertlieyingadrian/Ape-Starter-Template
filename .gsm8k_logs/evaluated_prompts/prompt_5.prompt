    question: Vincent has 72 inches of rope that he wants to use for a project, but
      he needs to cut it into smaller pieces first. He cuts it into 12 equal length
      pieces, but then he realizes it's too short, so he ties three pieces together.
      The knots then make each piece 1 inch shorter. How long are his pieces of rope
      after all this?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '15'
    gold_reasoning: Each small piece is 6 inches because 72 / 12 = <<72/12=6>>6. Each
      piece is then 5 inches long after the knots are tied because 6-1=<<5=5>>5 The
      three pieces tied together are now 15 inches long because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15

    question: Bruno wants to buy two and one-half dozens of pens. How many pens will
      he have?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '30'
    gold_reasoning: Since a dozen is equal to 12, then two dozens are equal to 12
      x 2= <<24=24>>24. One-half dozen is equal to 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6. Thus, Bruno
      will have a total of 24 + 6 = <<24+6=30>>30 pens.

    question: Dave bought 8 books about animals, 6 books about outer space, and 3
      books about trains to keep him busy over the holidays. Each book cost $6. How
      much did Dave spend on the books?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '102'
    gold_reasoning: "Dave buys 8 books + 6 books + 3 books = <<8+6+3=17>>17 books\
      \ in total. He has to spend 17 books \xD7 $6/book = $<<17*6=102>>102 if he wants\
      \ to buy all the books."

    question: Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice. He
      also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it. How many
      minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '280'
    gold_reasoning: 'First find the total rise time: 120 minutes * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240
      minutes Then add the rise time to the baking and kneading time: 240 minutes
      + 10 minutes + 30 minutes = <<240+10+30=280>>280 minutes'

    question: John decides to replace all his hats.  He has enough hats to wear a
      different one every day for 2 weeks.  If each hat costs $50 how much do his
      hats cost?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '700'
    gold_reasoning: He has 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 hats So they cost 14*50=$<<14*50=700>>700
