    question: During the soccer match, The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period
      and twice that amount in the second period.  The other team, The Spiders, scored
      half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period and twice the amount
      that The Kickers scored in their second period.  What is the total amount of
      goals both teams scored?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '15'
    gold_reasoning: The Kickers scored twice as many as 2 goals in the second period,
      so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 goals The Spiders scored half as many as The Kickers' 2
      goals from the 1st period so .5*2 = <<2*.5=1>>1 goal in the first period The
      Spiders scored twice as many as The Kickers' 4 goals from the second period,
      so 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 goals in the second period Together, they scored 2+4+1+8
      = <<2+4+1+8=15>>15 goals total

    question: "Mandy\u2019s phone data plan charges $30 per month for data. Her first\
      \ month, she got a promotional rate of one-third the normal price. However,\
      \ in the fourth month she went over her data limit and was charged an extra\
      \ fee of $15. How much did Mandy pay in the first 6 months for data?"
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '175'
    gold_reasoning: Mandy paid 1/3 * 30 = 30 / 3 = $<<30/3=10>>10 for her first month
      of data. She paid 30 + 15 = $<<30+15=45>>45 for her fourth month of data. Minus
      those two months, she had 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4 months of regular charges. Thus,
      Mandy paid 4 * 30 + 10 + 45 = 120 + 55 = $<<4*30+10+45=175>>175 for the first
      6 months for data.

    question: Brayden and Gavin were playing touch football against Cole and Freddy.
      Touchdowns were worth 7 points. Brayden and Gavin scored 7 touchdowns. Cole
      and Freddy's team scored 9 touchdowns. How many more points did Cole and Freddy
      have than Brayden and Gavin?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '14'
    gold_reasoning: Brayden and Gavin scored 7 touchdowns * 7 points each = <<7*7=49>>49
      points. Cole and Freddy scored 9 touchdowns * 7 points each = <<9*7=63>>63 points.
      Cole and Freddy's team had 63 - 49 points = <<63-49=14>>14 points more than
      Brayden and Gavin's team.

      \ character has eight more lines than the second character. The third character\
      \ only has two lines. The second character has six more than three times the\

  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '20'
    gold_reasoning: The second character has 6 + 3 * 2 = 6 + 6 = <<6+3*2=12>>12 lines.
      The first character has 12 + 8 = <<12+8=20>>20 lines.
