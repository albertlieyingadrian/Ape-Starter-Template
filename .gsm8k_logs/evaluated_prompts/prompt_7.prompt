    question: If the wages of 15 workers for 6 days is $9450. What would be the wages
      for 19 workers for 5 days?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '9975'
    gold_reasoning: This is equivalent to one worker working for 15 * 6 = <<15*6=90>>90
      days. The pay per worker per day would be $9450 / 90 = $<<9450/90=105>>105.
      19 workers working for 5 days is equivalent to one worker working for 19 * 5
      = <<19*5=95>>95 days. It would cost $105 * 95 = $<<105*95=9975>>9975 to pay
      the workers for their time.

    question: Ali had a stock of 800 books in his Room. He sold 60 on Monday, 10 on
      Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday, 44 on Thursday and 66 on Friday. How many books were
      not sold?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '600'
    gold_reasoning: "We look first for the total number of books that were sold: 60\
      \ + 10 + 20 + 44 + 66 = <<60+10+20+44+66=200>>200 books. So the total number\
      \ of books that were not sold is: 800 \u2013 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 books."

    question: James buys pistachios for $10 per can.  Each can is 5 ounces.  He eats
      30 ounces of pistachios every 5 days.  How much does he spend on pistachios
      per week?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '84'
    gold_reasoning: The pistachios cost 10/5=$<<10/5=2>>2 per ounce He eats 30/5=<<30/5=6>>6
      ounces of pistachios a day So he spends 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12 per day on pistachios
      So he spends 12*7=$<<12*7=84>>84 per week

    question: "\u0410 Senior Center is hosting a bingo night. $2,400 in prize money\
      \ will be given away. The first winner of the night will receive a third of\
      \ the money. The next ten winners will each receive a 10th of the remaining\
      \ amount. How many dollars will each of the next ten winners receive?"
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '160'
    gold_reasoning: The first winner will receive 2400 / 3 = $<<2400/3=800>>800. There
      will be 2400 - 800 = $<<2400-800=1600>>1600 left. The other winners will receive
      1600 / 10 = $<<1600/10=160>>160 each.

    question: My age is five times that of my son. Next year, my son will be eight
      years old. How old am I now?
  metadata:
    split: train
  outputs:
    answer: '35'
    gold_reasoning: If the son is going to be eight years old after a year from now,
      then currently, he is 8-1 = <<8-1=7>>7 Since the father's age is five times
      that of the son, currently he is 5*7 = <<5*7=35>>35 years old.
